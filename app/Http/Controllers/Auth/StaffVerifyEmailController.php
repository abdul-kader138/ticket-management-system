/**
 * Email verification for STAFF (Filament panel) accounts, linked from
 * App\Notifications\Auth\VerifyEmail. Deliberately has no auth-session
 * requirement — Filament's own verify route sits behind Authenticate
 * middleware, so its link 302s to /login whenever it is opened on a device
 * the user isn't signed in on (i.e. almost always: people open the email
 * on their phone).
 *
 * Security is unchanged: the route carries Laravel's `signed` middleware,
 * so the URL cannot be forged, altered or replayed past its expiry, and
 * the {hash} segment is sha1(user email) — the link dies the moment the
 * address changes.
 *
 * Customers use a separate, already-existing route (`verification.verify`
 * in routes/api.php) that redirects to the frontend SPA instead.
